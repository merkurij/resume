    <p>As a member of the platform team, my responsibilities include the development and support of an infrastructure monitoring system that monitors approximately 10,000 hardware hosts and 50,000 cloud containers. I am responsible for collecting requirements, analyzing them, and making decisions about the system's future. Additionally, I am responsible for the development and support of an operational statistics visualization tool that is used by thousands of employees in our company to operate several projects with a combined audience of 150 million users and almost a billion USD in revenue. Furthermore, I am responsible for interviewing, mentoring, and providing career guidance to new employees in our company.</p>

    <p>As a web architecture leader, I was responsible for managing a development team of 25+ engineers, hiring new team members, mentoring newcomers, lecturing students at top Russian universities, and overseeing a website with more than 40 million daily users. The website generated half a billion USD in income annually. During my tenure, I successfully led the team to triple the website's audience, quadruple its income, scale the team to 200 engineers, and implement robust processes to prevent production catastrophes. Overall, I have the experience of managing a large team, delivering a product that generates a significant amount of revenue and scaling it to a large scale.</p>

    <p>I began my tenure at OK.RU as a senior web developer and quickly created a web interface for a music service that outperformed Spotify's at the time. I continued to develop and improve the music web interface while becoming deeply interested in web performance optimization. After some time, I successfully convinced the company's CEO of the importance of web performance, and in less than a year, I made the website two times faster on initial load and significantly faster overall. This resulted in a great success, leading to my promotion to Web Development Team Leader.</p>

    <p>As a highly experienced Java developer, I have progressed to a leadership role as the engineering team leader on a major project. My duties include analyzing technical requirements, collaborating with clients on technical solutions, setting development team goals, managing task execution, mentoring team members, and providing guidance for career development.</p>

    <p>I was an integral member of the development team responsible for creating a new claim management workflow system for Swiss Re. My specific role was to design and develop the user interface using the ZKoss framework. Initially intended as a proof-of-concept, the project ultimately proved to be a success and became a key component of the company's portfolio, ultimately becoming the largest project the company had undertaken at that point.</p>

    <p>I played a significant role in a research lab where we explored the potential use of new web technologies in our projects. One of my most notable accomplishments in this role was the development of a common components library. This library has served as the primary tool for creating user interfaces within the company, to my knowledge it still does.</p>
