    <p>I've started job at OK.RU as senior web developer, and in less than a year I've created web interface for music service, which was better than Spotify had at the time. After initial launch I've continued music web interface development, but at the same time I've got huge interest in web performance optimizations.

      It took me a while to sell the idea of importance of web performance to companies CEO. But after that in less than a year I made our web site two times faster on an initial load, and significantly faster overall. The results I had was a great success, and I ended up being promoted to Web Development Team Leader.</p>

    <p>I was part of the development team responsible for development of new claim managment workflow system for Swiss Re. My job was to create UI for this project using UI framework <a href="https://www.zkoss.org/" target="_blank">ZKoss</a>. This project was intended to be a quick way to check ZKoss if it suites as main UI Framework for the company, but ended up being one of the most important pieces of companies portfolio, and at some point the biggest project company had.</p>
