    The website generated half a billion USD in income annually. During my tenure, 
    I successfully led the team to triple the website's audience, quadruple its income, scale the team to 200 engineers,

    I began my tenure at OK.RU as a senior web developer and quickly created a web interface for a 
    music service that outperformed Spotify's at the time. I continued to develop and improve the music web 
    interface while becoming deeply interested in web performance optimization. After some time, 
    I successfully convinced the company's CEO of the importance of web performance, and in less than a year,
