    <h1><span>About me</span></h1>
    <p>I'm Software Engineer with strong knowledge of core web technologies. Mainly I write my code on a backend using Java language. I have a great passion for performance optimization, and as part of my current job I manage team responsible for this topic in our company.
    As I already mentioned, my primary programming language is Java, but never the less during my professional career I've wrote a lot of code using JavaScript.
    Most of my work experience is tightly connected to teamwork, complex problem solving, and product management. For many years I'm developing skills to help teams communicate, set clear goals and reach them faster.</p>

    <p>We all know how hard is to find good developers this days. During my first year on this position I've started giving lectures at top Russian universities and eventually hired 4 junior developers, and helped them to become a great software engineers. During the next year we made a ton of good stuff for our company.
      We took our old, slow and ugly reporting system, and made a replacement from scratch. It works blazingly fast and stable. This project is so successful, that our parent company started using this product as well.
      We made a beautiful corporate website. We completely reengineered registration system for OK.RU on all platforms, including mobile devices. As a result conversion rate in registration grew up from 65% t–æ 90%.
      At some point we needed a new challenge, and we've accepted proposal to make our core service better. As a social network, our core service is a social graph. Our goal was to make it's growth 50% faster year over year. As a result in 6 month we accelerate growth for 90% year over year.</p>
