    <h1><span>About me</span></h1>
    <p>I'm Software Engineer with strong knowledge of core web technologies. Mainly I write my code on a backend using Java language. I have a great passion for performance optimization, and as part of my current job I manage team responsible for this topic in our company.
    As I already mentioned, my primary programming language is Java, but never the less during my professional career I've wrote a lot of code using JavaScript.
    Most of my work experience is tightly connected to teamwork, complex problem solving, and product management. For many years I'm developing skills to help teams communicate, set clear goals and reach them faster.</p>

    <p>We all know how hard is to find good developers this days. During my first year on this position I've started giving lectures at top Russian universities and eventually hired 4 junior developers, and helped them to become a great software engineers. During the next year we made a ton of good stuff for our company.
      We took our old, slow and ugly reporting system, and made a replacement from scratch. It works blazingly fast and stable. This project is so successful, that our parent company started using this product as well.
      We made a beautiful corporate website. We completely reengineered registration system for OK.RU on all platforms, including mobile devices. As a result conversion rate in registration grew up from 65% tо 90%.
      At some point we needed a new challenge, and we've accepted proposal to make our core service better. As a social network, our core service is a social graph. Our goal was to make it's growth 50% faster year over year. As a result in 6 month we accelerate growth for 90% year over year.</p>

    <p>I've started job at OK.RU as web developer, and in less then a year I've created web interface for music service, which is better then Spotify has. After initial launch I've continued music web interface development, but at the same time I got huge interest in web performance optimization.
      It took me a while to sell idea of needing of web performance optimization to company CEO. After that in less then a year we made our web site two times faster on an initial load. We've implemented a lot of best practises, and reengineered a lot of code several times to achieve than results.
      At that time we had decent amount of GWT on your front-end, being almost monolith it caused major performance issues. The main goal was to make product teams write code on native JS and lazy load it. After all this was achieved I started new position in our company.</p>

    <p>I've started job at OK.RU as senior web developer, and in less than a year I've created web interface for music service, which was better than Spotify had at the time. After initial launch I've continued music web interface development, but at the same time I've got huge interest in web performance optimizations.

      It took me a while to sell the idea of importance of web performance to companies CEO. But after that in less than a year I made our web site two times faster on an initial load, and significantly faster overall. The results I had was a great success, and I ended up being promoted to Web Development Team Leader.</p>

    <p>I was part of the development team responsible for development of new claim managment workflow system for Swiss Re. My job was to create UI for this project using UI framework <a href="https://www.zkoss.org/" target="_blank">ZKoss</a>. This project was intended to be a quick way to check ZKoss if it suites as main UI Framework for the company, but ended up being one of the most important pieces of companies portfolio, and at some point the biggest project company had.</p>
